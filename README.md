# Multidimensional_Information_Assisted_Deep_Learning_Realizing_Flexible_Recognition_of_Vortex_Beam_Mo
This project made use of both intensity and phase information to recognize orbital angular momentum mode.

This project include codes for optical simulation and neural network.

Note: 
- We encourage you to cite paper "Multidimensional Information Assisted Deep Learning Realizing Flexible Recognition of Vortex Beam Modes".
- Part of code came from Shuiqing Zheng, We also encourage you to cite paper written by Shuiqin Zheng.
