# Multidimensional Information Assisted Deep Learning Realizing Flexible Recognition of Vortex Beam Modes
This is the official implementation of "Multidimensional Information Assisted Deep Learning Realizing Flexible Recognition of Vortex Beam Modes".

This project made use of both intensity and phase information to recognize orbital angular momentum mode.

This project include codes for optical simulation and neural network.

Note:
